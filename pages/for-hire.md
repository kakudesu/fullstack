1. [Online Music player](https://github.com/DingSoung/music)  
At firs it just is a application of AVFoundation with basic control and visual objects such as precess slider,real-time,and toggle play/pause buttom,then difficulties came when I wanted to access Douban FM API, whoses data need network and JSON phrase ,at times ready－made ware rare, I try to use basic closure socket to request data and transfer it into dictinory, after a lot of learn and try, online playlist table relized reluctantly. Laterly I found Alamofire and SwiftyJSON wwhich greatly simplify the code and grasped the usages quickly.   //突出学习和调试能力
2. [Photo filter](https://github.com/DingSoung/photo)  
this app use the IOS8 build-in Filter,based on the development of others,however,considering of convenience, I transfer the filter functions into to a picker, hide upon image viewer,touch and swipe to apply filter real-time, which is user-friendly, and to easy. //突出调优，改进能力
3. [Embedded web Apps](https://github.com/DingSoung/webApp)  
One product need develop more mobild clients,,IOS,Android,WP,and more if Pads include,while develop for each one is obviously unwise, we need a cross-platform tool,and usually web is a good choise, thus I start this project, help me to reuse web code such as HTML5 CSS to save developing time.//突出对行业和技术的了解和洞察发展趋势的能力

Data structure, Digital signal processing, Signal and system, Embedded system, Digital communication principle
* Research,Competition,Awards,Papers & Graduation Design:  
In 2010, I started a project. As team leader of 5 selected members, I design the framework and detailed functions of each part. After realizing the basic feature,I improved the stability and efficiency, system memory and time are greatly saved. In 2011, we won the fund form schools, at the beginning of 2012 my papers about the project was published, at the same time, my graduation project was assessed A.

####Background

#### Award

####Others
I once worked on embedded system, and turn to IOS App develop since Apple's 2014 WWDC when the swift language was published, In these months I start from using basic controls,network communications,data phrase,then learn to use libraries such as SwiftyJSON,Alamofire,also I practiced UI designing with sketch,now I had make several apps, and gained  my own experience, these increase self-confidence to join mobile and network developing.
