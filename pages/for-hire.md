####Personal Project & Technical summary
1. [Online Music player](https://github.com/DingSoung/music)  
At firs it just is a application of AVFoundation with basic control and visual objects such as precess slider,real-time,and toggle play/pause buttom,then difficulties came when I wanted to access Douban FM API, whoses data need network and JSON phrase ,at times ready－made ware rare, I try to use basic closure socket to request data and transfer it into dictinory, after a lot of learn and try, online playlist table relized reluctantly. Laterly I found Alamofire and SwiftyJSON wwhich greatly simplify the code and grasped the usages quickly.
2. [Photo filter](https://github.com/DingSoung/photo)  
this app use the IOS8 build-in Filter,based on the development of others,however,considering of convenience, I transfer the filter functions into to a picker, hide upon image viewer,touch and swipe to apply filter real-time, which is user-friendly, and to easy. 
3. [Embedded web Apps](https://github.com/DingSoung/webApp)  
One product need develop more mobild clients,,IOS,Android,WP,and more if Pads include,while develop for each one is obviously unwise, we need a cross-platform tool,and usually web is a good choise, thus I start this project, help me to reuse web code such as HTML5 CSS to save developing time.
