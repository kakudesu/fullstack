Hi, I‘m a IOS software engineer,I am currently seeking more suitable careers, here is my basic information, if you would like to get touch with me,send an e-mail or call me directly.

####Work Experence
######Software Engineer at Dediprog 2013.12 — Now
* IC support: Write kinds of communication IO and protocols with assembly language, and use C language control process, FLASH,EEPROM and varieties of programmable MCU such as power control,touch screen, motors controller ware supported, as well as AVR, ARM7, cortex M MCU,theses amplified series helped to expand the customer source and get more orders.
* Optimize burning method: adjust the timing to make it works faster and more stable, especially for OTP series chip with JTAG interface ,witch usually unstable and has complex protocol, by using IAP,ping-pong cache technology to improve performance close to theoretical value,speeded up to 2.5x than usual, fail rate controlled in 0.05%.
* Upgrade Framework:Worked on new framework with 5 other RD,support more complex programmable areas and types of IC, promoted highest burning speed, programmer works offline, and reduced dependence on PC. Support the XML configuration option dialog IC support, this saves supporting time. The Firmware layer coordinate bus layer’s works, reserved memory for bus layer, make it possible to do data phrase, verification, comparison real-time and accurately.

######Embeded Software Engineer at PointLine 2012.12 — 2013.12
* Sample and analyze module of acquisition: Programming MCU with C language to drive peripherals.Instead of RTOS,I improved performance and stability by using designed state machine,witch greatly simplify system,saves more memory and time for data process.
* Design Algorithm:Simulate via Matlab,by studying papers making experiments, a more suitable algorithm witch has optimization of sampling signal processing algorithm, adapt to the wider frequency and amplitude dynamic range was designed,this keep the calculation error in ppm, and final result reduce from the original 0.5% to 0.2%.

####Education
* B.S.Eng of Xiangnan University, Electronic information & science technology,2009 NCRE2 CET4 
* Undergraduate Coursework:  
Data structure, Digital signal processing, Signal and system, Embedded system, Digital communication principle
* Research,Competition,Awards,Papers & Graduation Design:  
In 2010, I started a project. As team leader of 5 selected members, I design the framework and detailed functions of each part. After realizing the basic feature,I improved the stability and efficiency, system memory and time are greatly saved. In 2011, we won the fund form schools, at the beginning of 2012 my papers about the project was published, at the same time, my graduation project was assessed A.

####Personal Project & Technical summary
1. [Online Music player](https://github.com/DingSoung/music)  
At firs it just is a application of AVFoundation with basic control and visual objects such as precess slider,real-time,and toggle play/pause buttom,then difficulties came when I wanted to access Douban FM API, whoses data need network and JSON phrase ,at times ready－made ware rare, I try to use basic closure socket to request data and transfer it into dictinory, after a lot of learn and try, online playlist table relized reluctantly. Laterly I found Alamofire and SwiftyJSON wwhich greatly simplify the code and grasped the usages quickly.
2. [Photo filter](https://github.com/DingSoung/photo)  
this app use the IOS8 build-in Filter,based on the development of others,however,considering of convenience, I transfer the filter functions into to a picker, hide upon image viewer,touch and swipe to apply filter real-time, which is user-friendly, and to easy. 
3. [Embedded web Apps](https://github.com/DingSoung/webApp)  
One product need develop more mobild clients,,IOS,Android,WP,and more if Pads include,while develop for each one is obviously unwise, we need a cross-platform tool,and usually web is a good choise, thus I start this project, help me to reuse web code such as HTML5 CSS to save developing time.
4. [UI design](https://github.com/DingSoung/design)  
this project is my sketch repository, which my copy painting and few self-design, inspired by mental design,Click the link above to watch.

####Others
* I once worked on embedded system, and turn to IOS App develop since Apple's 2014 WWDC when the swift language was published, In these months I start from using basic controls,network communications,data phrase,then learn to use libraries such as SwiftyJSON,Alamofire,also I practiced UI designing with sketch,now I had make several apps, and gained  my own experience, these increase self-confidence to join mobile and network developing. However ,as a new men, I know the lack of work experience, this is a unavoidable process,I must keep trying all my efforts to learn and design best apps, all I need is an opportunity, that's why I found you.

*How about my work attitude,performance and ability?*  

* As a developer obsessed with technology, I always deal with general affairs of my work with rigorous attitude,try my best to finish every project in time and without serious bugs, and it sincerely happy to saw my works being praised, and bring revenue.In the last year,my manager assessed my professional effectiveness and work efficiency 7 score witch means exceed goals,proactivity,time management and problem solving 8 score,almost far exceed goals. If you'r interesting the detail, you can also visit page <http://dingsoung.ml/pages/resume.html> about my past work experence.

*Why turn to current industry?*  

* Broaden my eyesight,follow my heart, choose the best which is worth time I'm spending ,as my career

*What's my advantages?*  

* Benefit form my course work and my past work experence about embedded system and firmware,I schievements distinctive advantage of **Debug and Improve**, especially for pursuit of **performance** as well as the **beauty of Code**.
